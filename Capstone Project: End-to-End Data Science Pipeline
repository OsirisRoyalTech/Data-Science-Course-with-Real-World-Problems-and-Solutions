# Capstone Project: End-to-End Data Science Pipeline
Problem: Create an end-to-end data science project that involves data wrangling, feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and deployment.
Objective: Choose a real-world dataset (e.g., customer segmentation, fraud detection, sentiment analysis) and go through all stages of a data science pipeline.

Tasks:
  •	Collect and clean data.
  •	Perform exploratory data analysis.
  •	Build and evaluate multiple machine learning models.
  •	Deploy the best model in a web application.

Outcome: This project will serve as the final proof of the student’s ability to handle end-to-end data science workflows.
